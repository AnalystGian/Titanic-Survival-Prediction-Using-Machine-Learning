In this project, we will build, train and test a machine learning model to predict titanic survivors based on their features such as age, number of siblings, and ticket class. We will explore two machine learning algorithms, namely:
(1) logistic regression classifier model and;
(2) Naive Bayes classifier model.

LEARNING OBJECTIVES
1. Perform data cleaning, feature engineering and visualization
2. Build, train and test a logistic regression classifier model in Sklearn
3. Understand the theory and intuition behind logistic regression classifier models
